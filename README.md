This is PRODIGY_DS_02 task. The task was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis(EDA) on a dataset of your choice and explore the relationships between the variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
I first did some cleaning and preprocessing of the datas via excel. By formatting the cells and conditional formating methods. I removed the duplicates and missing values as well.
Nextly, I used R programming tool to visualise and identify the patterns and trends in the findings. I did visualisations on 5 major details of the data.
1. Sales by category: In that technology suppies are in the lead for sales.
2. Profit by region: In this, east region is in the first lead.
I also did boxplots for Sales and Profit Distribution by Segment and Profit distribution by segment.
Lastly, a correlation matrix was done entirely to check upon the whole data.
